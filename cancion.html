    <p class="titulo"> CanÂ´t Sleep </p>
    
    <p id="parrafo1"> Maybe I've been slipping back, heading south, carsick on a Tuesday<br>
        Missing cash, blacking out, heartless in a few ways<br>
        Shit for luck, elbows shredded, I held things steady like too late<br>
        Please calm the fuck down, I'll do whatever you say<br>
        I get it, I get it, I'm living too hard and it's time that I stop it<br>
        But rising on up and then tumbling down well it's part of the process<br>
        Bar tabs on a hot night in a cold basement<br>
        You say I'm crazy but I feel amazing<br>
    </p>
  
  
    <p id="parrafo2"> My mother told me that the world has got it's plans<br>
        I wanna hold 'em 'til they burn right through my hands<br>
        Don't ask me questions cause I'm tired of confessing<br>
        And I know that it's not much to say but I swear that I'd like to change<br>
   
   
    </p>
     
        <p id="parrafo3"> I can't sleep, I hope I stay awake<br>
            'Cause I've been running, running, running all day<br>
            Long nights, no peace, I feel like everybody's eyes on me<br>
   
        </p>
   
            <p id="parrafo4"> I can't sleep, I hope I stay awake<br>
        'Cause I've been running, running, running all day<br>
        Long nights, no peace, I feel like everybody's eyes on me<br>
        I can't sleep <br>
        I can't sleep <br>
        I can't sleep <br>
        I can't sleep<br>
    </p>
    
    <p id="parrafo5">Maybe I've been freaking out, moving quick, burning the wick at both ends<br>
        Screaming loud, stupid shit, scaring all of my old friends<br>
        Fell down on Bedford, hope that it's not broken<br>
        Safe to say I might have had too much of some of these potions<br>
        I love you so much, I'm staying here all night<br>
        Don't want to get up, I don't want to stop, I don't want to close my eyes<br>
        I'd rather not give a fuck and end up with some scars<br>
        The night's just long enough for me to build it all and let it fall apart<br>
   
    </p>
      
    <p id="parrafo6"> My mother told me that the world has got it's plans<br>
        I wanna hold 'em 'til they burn right through my hands<br>
        Don't ask me questions cause I'm tired of confessing<br>
        And I know that it's not much to say but I swear that I'd like to change<br>
